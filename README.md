Let's Play a Mind-Reading Game!

1. Think of a number in your head. Don't tell me, just keep it secret.
2. I'll start guessing your number, and you just need to tell me if my guess is:
   2.1. Larger than your number,
   2.2. Smaller than your number, 
   2.3. Right if I nailed it!

Don't worry if I get it wrong a few times... I'm learning, and I won't stop until I win!
The idea comes from Jady
